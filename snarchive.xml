<description>This week we briefly touch on last week's Patch Tuesday for both Windows and Android, the world's two most used operating systems. We look at a recent emergency update to Firefox and the need to keep all of our systems' UEFI firmware up to date. NVIDIA suffers a huge and quite embarrassing network breach, and ProtonMail handles their Russian customers correctly. The Linux kernel has seen some challenging times recently, and Russia has decided to start signing website certificates. Research was just published to put some numbers to WordPress add-ons' observably miserable security, and the European Union legislators who brought us GDPR and mandatory website cookie notifications are at it again. What now?</description>

<description>This week we examine many of the cyber-consequences of Russia's unilateral aggression against Ukraine. In a world as interconnected as today, can a rogue nation go it alone? Ukraine has formed a volunteer IT Army. Hacking groups are picking sides. Is Starlink a hope? Actors on both sides of Russia's borders are selectively blocking Internet content. Google has become proactive. The Namecheap registrar has withdrawn service. Use of the Telegram encrypted messenger service has exploded. Cryptocurrency exchanges block tens of thousands of wallets. Russia releases the IP addresses and domains attacking them, and likely some which are not. They also prepare to amend their laws to permit software piracy and appear to be preparing to entirely disconnect from the global Internet. All of the technologies we've been talking about for years are in play.</description>

<description>This week we examine the consequences of paying ransomware extortion demands. How did that work out for you? We take a deep look into "Daxin," a somewhat terrifying malware from attackers linked to China. We take something of a retrospective look at Log4j and draw some lessons from its trajectory.  We touch on some technical consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including which kitchen appliances Russia's servers are claiming to be, and the question of the possible consequences of the U.S. becoming involved in launching some cyberattacks at Russia.  We have a piece of interesting listener feedback and the results of last week's next SpinRite development pre-release.  Then we're going to take a look at the significant mistake Samsung made which crippled and compromised the security of all 100 million of their most recently made Smartphones.</description>

<description>This week we talk about another WordPress plug-in mess, this one so bad that WordPress themselves force-installed updates on more than three million sites.  We look at the new Xenomorph Android malware and at a mistake made by a new and prominent ransomware service.  We examine why blurring or pixelating text for redaction was never a good idea, and what can go wrong with a plan to shut off one's teenagers' Internet access at home. We unfortunately need to revisit the supercritical Magento/Adobe Commerce platform patch which didn't quite work completely the first time, and we consider the implications of the technology behind last week's denial-of-service attacks on some of Ukraine's critical infrastructure.  Then, after quick sci-fi and SpinRite updates, we'll take a look at an effective and lucrative attack that was perpetrated by deliberately abusing the still-too-trusting Border Gateway Protocol.</description>

<description>This week we look at a couple of new zero-days in Chrome and Apple's OSes.  We also look at what the U.S. CISA thinks of not only these, but of 15 other problems that our federal agencies seem to be in no big hurry to fix.  And we revisit last summer's SeriousSAM vulnerability in Windows which remains under attack.  This being the third Tuesday of the month, we'll look back at the second Tuesday to see how that went.  Sunday saw a true emergency patch issued by Adobe that probably canceled some Super Bowl plans, and we have an amazingly bad idea for a WordPress add-on. Google has published their 2021 Bounty Report, and their Project Zero has published stats about how things are going there.  We have Microsoft removing a popular and highly abused feature of Windows.  And then, because nothing else in the past week commanded the podcast's title, I'll wind up by formally introducing GRC's latest freeware which puts its users firmly "InControl."</description>

<description>This week we're going to take a look at our law enforcement and cyber-defense recommendations regarding safe conduct while in Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. We're going to take a look at a serious CVSS 9.9 vulnerability affecting Linux's use of SAMBA, and at some interesting details of so-called “Living off the Land” exploitation of commonly present operating system utilities. We'll examine Microsoft's most recent approach to application packaging and installation triggered by their recent wholesale neutering of it's primary application and feature. And we're also going to celebrate a welcome change in Microsoft policy that's been 20 years in the making. I'll share a brief pre-announcement of a new forthcoming GRC quickie freeware utility. Then we'll take a close look at “MY2022” the iOS and Android application which all attendees of the Beijing Olympics are required to install, carry and use. Citizen Lab's reverse-engineering analysis will explain how this week's podcast got its name.</description>

<description>This is another of those weeks where we're going to go deeper into fewer topics rather than broader across more topics, with Google's newly announced and explained “Topics” API of course being our title story. So we'll start by looking at “PwnKit” which is a startling and long standing local privilege escalation vulnerability which has existed in every distribution of Linux since May of 2009. It's a MUST PATCH for Linux systems. We'll then look at another of the blessedly few Log4j exploits which is actually happening, update on two new Zerodium limited-time bounty “offers” and at a new means for fingerprinting web browsers. I have a totally random bit of miscellany to share in the form of a tip, a SpinRite update and some closing the loop feedback from our terrific listeners. Then we'll wrap up by taking a really interesting deep dive into Google's new ad-targeting “Topics” API.</description>

<description>This week we briefly touch on the ongoing Log4j background noise. We look at the result of the insurance industry's pushback against ransomware coverage and at the resulting changing cyber-insurance landscape. We look at another WordPress add-on problem and a supply-chain attack on a very popular add-on provider. We also wonder whether WordPress still makes sense in 2022? We cover the EU's quite welcome major bug bounty funding, and Kaspersky's discovery of a very difficult to root out UEFI bootkit. We'll share some interesting questions and topics suggested by our listeners, then we're going to take another of our recent technical deep dives to examine the precise cause of that pervasive NetUSB flaw – it's really fun and completely understandable!</description>

<description>This week we start off by looking at how the U.S. Pentagon is dealing with Log4j and how the U.S. administration at the While House wants to improve the security of open source software. This being the 3rd Tuesday of the month, we'll look back last week's decidedly mixed-blessing Patch Tuesday – the good and the unfortunate. We'll then look at a very serious new remotely exploitable problem which affects many popular routers – and provide a shortcut of the week to immediately check your own routers – and then over a new and very welcome access control standard being introduced by the W3C which Chrome is already in the process of adopting. We'll wrap up the top portion of the podcast with yet another set of very serious WordPress add-on blunders. Then we'll share a bit of listener feedback, including answering the very popular questions about refilling empty SodaStream tanks. And after a brief SpinRite progress update we're going to take a close look inside the operation of an actual, Iranian, Log4j exploit kit.</description>

<description>This week we'll begin with another in our series of Log4j updates which includes among a few other bits of news, an instance of a real-world vulnerability and the FTC's somewhat surprising and aggressive message. We'll chronicle the Chrome browser's first largish update of 2022 and also note the gratifying 2021 growth of the privacy-centric Brave browser. WordPress needs updating, but this time not an add-on but WordPress itself. We're going to then answer the age-old question posed during last Wednesday's Windows Weekly podcast: “What exactly is a Pluton? and how many can dance on the head of a pin?” And finally, after a quick Sci-Fi reading recommendation and a very brief touch on my ongoing SpinRite work, we're going to take a gratifyingly deep dive into the unfortunate vagaries of our industry's URL parsing libraries to see just how much trouble we're in as a result of no two of them parsing URLs in exactly the same way.</description>

<description>This week we start off the new year with a handful of Log4j updates including yet another fix from Apache; some false positive alarms; Alibaba in the doghouse; and an underwhelming announcement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  We note the postponement of a critical industry security conference, an interesting aspirational announcement from DuckDuckGo's CEO, and the soon-to-be-rising costs of cyber insurance.  Then, after a bit of miscellany and a SpinRite update, we look at the surprising technological decision that has forced the official creation of December 33rd.</description>

<description>There was no way that a massively widespread vulnerability in Java with a CVSS score of 10.0 would be wrapped up in a week.  So this week we'll look at the further consequences of the Log4j vulnerabilities, including the two additional updates the Apache group have since released.  But before that we'll look at what will hopefully be Chrome's final zero-day patch of the year, Firefox's surprise refusal to take its users to Microsoft.com, and Mozilla's decision to protect its users from Windows 10 cloud-based clipboard sharing.  We have a new and interesting means of increasing the power of fraudulent cell tower Stingray attacks, and a continuing threat from cross-radio WiFi-to-Bluetooth leakage.  We'll touch on a sci-fi reminder and a SpinRite update, then dig into what's happened since last week on the Log4j front.</description>

<description>This week we will, of course, be discussing what's being called the worst Internet-wide security catastrophe in recent memory. Log4Shell is not like Spectre or Meltdown, which were academic theories. This is at the far other end of that spectrum. But first we're going to talk a bit about last week's massive Amazon network services outage and the unfortunate but probably inevitable abuse of Apple's AirTag ecosystem. I need to correct the record over my undeserved praise, last week, for Windows 11 and its loosening grip over its Edge browser association, and we need to warn all WordPress site admins about a new and serious set of threats. We have a single item of closing the loop feedback about today's main topic, a bit of Sci-Fi and a SpinRite update. Then, we'll roll up our sleeves and by the end of today's episode listening will understand exactly how, why and what happened with Log4j and Log4Shell.</description>

<description>This week Tavis Ormandy finds a bug in Mozilla's NSS signature verification. We look at the horrifying lack of security in smartwatches for children (smartwatches for children?!?), and at the next six VPN services to be banned in Russia. Microsoft softens the glue between Windows 11 and Edge, bad guys find a new way of slipping malware into our machines, a botnet uses the bitcoin blockchain for backup communications, and HP has 150 printer models in dire need of firmware updates. We touch on sci-fi and SpinRite, then we look at new research into an entirely new class of cross-site privacy breaches affecting every web browser including a test every user can run for themselves on their various browsers.</description>

<description>This week we'll note that the new Edge browser's Super Duper Secure Mode has been deployed and can be enabled by security-conscious users. We also have more than one third 37% of the world's smartphones vulnerable to audio monitoring and recording flaws in their MediaTek firmware. We have an important reminder about clicking links in email and wonder how that can still be a problem, and the entirely predictable evolution of a Windows zero-day vulnerability which is latent no longer. We have some interesting closing-the-loop feedback from our terrific listeners, and a sci-fi book update. Then we take another and much broader look at the recent efforts to clean up IPv4, but this time from the perspective of those working to do so.</description>

<description>We're going to start off this week by taking a careful look at a shocking proposal being made by the Internet's Engineering Task Force, the IETF. They're proposing a change to a fundamental and long-standing aspect of the Internet's routing which I think must be doomed to fail. So we'll spend a bit of time on this in case it might actually happen. Then Microsoft reveals some results from their network of honeypots, and we update on the progress, or lack of, toward more secure passwords. GoDaddy suffers another major intrusion, and just about every Netgear router really does now need to receive a critical update for the fifth time this year. This one is very worrisome.</description>

<description>This week we look at a critical 9.8-rated vulnerability affecting Palo Alto Network's widely deployed VPN/Firewall appliance, and at a welcome new micropatch from the 0patch guys, the nature of which leads me into a bit of philosophical musing about the Zen of coding. We're then rocketed back to reality by a review of last week's Patch Tuesday, looking at what it broke and happily what more it fixed, including hints that Christmas might finally be coming to printing by December. We have some more encouraging ransomware vs the law news, and we examine the question of how to make big money defrauding online advertisers. I'll then share some fun and interesting closing the loop feedback from our listeners, update on my SpinRite work, and then we're going to take a look at “Blacksmith” – the evolution of Rowhammer attacks on DRAM.</description>

<description>This week we quickly cover a bunch of welcome news on the combating ransomware front. We look at the results from last week's Pwn2Own contest in Austin Texas and at a weird problem that only some users of Windows 11 started experiencing after Halloween. There's a serious problem with GitLab servers and additional supply-chain attacks on JavaScript's package management. Google fixed a bunch of things in Android last Tuesday, and Cisco has issued an emergency CVSS 9.8 alert and US Federal agencies are being ordered to patch hundreds of outstanding vulnerabilities. We have some fun closing the loop feedback from our listeners. I'm going to share the details of an interesting IRQ problem I tracked down last week. Then we'll take a look at an aspect of radio frequency fingerprinting that has apparently escaped everyone's notice until seven researchers from UCSD did the math.</description>

We check-in for Windows news from Redmond which I'm again unable to resist commenting upon, then we look at a surprise motherload of critical updates from Adobe and at the still-ongoing DDoS attacks against VoIP providers and their providers. We'll look at some fun and interesting Closing The Loop feedback from our listeners and I'm able to share some surprising early benchmarks from SpinRite. Then we finish by looking at a frighteningly clever and haunting new attack against source code known as “Trojan Source.”</description>

<description>This week we share some welcome news about Windows 11.  Leo gets his wish about REvil.  Microsoft improves vulnerability report management, attempts to explain their policy regarding the expiration of security updates, and prepares for the imminent release of the next big feature update to Windows 10, 21H2.  Zerodium publicly solicits vulnerabilities in three top VPN providers.  Three researchers disclose their new and devastating "Gummy Browser" attack, which I'll debunk.  Another massively popular JavaScript NPM package has been maliciously compromised and then widely downloaded.  We close the loop by looking at "Nubeva's" claims of having solved the ransomware problem.  We touch on a new annoyance spreading across websites, and also briefly touch on four sci-fi events:  "Dune," "Foundation," "Arrival," and "Invasion."  I briefly update on SpinRite.  Then we'll take a look back to share and discuss a conversation Leo and I had more than 20 years ago.  What's surprising is the degree to which "The More Things Change..." how little, like nothing, actually has.</description>

<description>This week we, of course, update on various controversies surrounding Win11 and catch up on the aftermath of last week's Patch Tuesday. We note that REvil's brief reappearance appears to have ended – perhaps this time forever – and we examine, just for the record, the outcome of the big, virtual, 30-nation anti-ransomware meeting where the invitations for China and Russia were apparently lost in the mail. We look at the amazing results of this past weekend's Tianfu Cup 2021 hacking competition in China, at the startling success of a prolific botnet's clipboard hijacking module, and at LinkedIn's decision to dramatically pare down its offerings in China. And then, after quickly sharing Sunday's big news about SpinRite, we're going to take a very fun and detailed look at the sophisticated senior prank orchestrated by Illinois' Minh Duong who miraculously sidestepped his own arrest.</description>

We look at Google's warning sent to more than 14,000 of its Gmail users and at their move toward enforced two-step verification. We look at recent hacking and ransom payment legislation and at last week's massive breach at Twitch. We cover the emergency Apache web server update and the mass exodus from WhatsApp during last week's Facebook outage. We look at new Windows 11 side effects and at Patch Tuesday. We close the loop with some listeners and I quickly update on SpinRite's progress. Then we settle down to consider the true significance and import of the various year-to-date 0-day counts.</description>

<description>This week we, of course, look at the massive global outage that took down all Facebook services for 6 hours yesterday. But before we get there we look at this week's new pair of 0-day flaws which Google fixed in Chrome, we note the arrival of Windows 11 with a yawn and also caution about one known flaw that it's already known to have. We look at some potential for global action against ransomware, and some possible movement by the FCC to thwart SIM swapping and number transporting attacks. We also examine a widespread Android Trojan which is making its attackers far too much money, and speaking of money, there's a known flaw in Apple Pay when using a VISA card that neither company wants to fix. And finally, after a quick check-in on SpinRite, we're going to examine what exactly did “go wrong” at Facebook yesterday?</description>

<description>This week we examine a new pair of 0-days which have forced emergency updates to their respective products. We examine the growing annoyance of those who are reporting bugs to Apple, Epik's belated confirmation of their mega data breach, Windows 11's further progress toward its release, and its new and much more useful PC Health Check tool. We look at some additional fallout from this month's ever-exciting Patch Tuesday and take notice of a clever new approach for bypassing anti-malware checking under Windows. And after a quick check-in about the first two episodes of AppleTV's Foundation series, we settle in to examine the week's most explosive, worrisome and somewhat controversial disclosure of yet another huge Microsoft screw-up which caused this week's episode to be given the domain name: autodiscover.fiasco.</description>

We checkout the once again mixed blessing of last Tuesday's Microsoft patches, and we examine a welcome feature of Android 11 that's being back-ported through Android 6. We catch-up with Chrome's patching of two more new 0-day vulnerabilities and attacks, then we look at a “Pwnage” eMail I received from Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned site – was GRC Pwned? I then have a quick Sci-Fi reminder for the end of the week, a SpinRite update and a fun related YouTube posting. Then we'll wrap up by introducing the latest weapon in the malign perpetrator's arsenal, the powerful commercial tool known as Cobalt Strike.</description>

<description>This week we're going to note the apparent return of REvil--not nearly as dead and gone as many hoped. We're going to look at a new and quite worrisome 0-day exploitation of an old Windows IE MHTML component. Even though IE is gone, it's guts live on in Windows. We're going to share the not surprising but still interesting results of security impact surveys taken of IT and home workers, after which we'll examine a fully practical JavaScript based Spectre attack on Chrome. I have bit of closing the loop feedback to share and a surprisingly serious question about the true nature of reality for us to consider. Then we'll finish out today's podcast by looking at the evolution of Internet DoS attacks through the years which recently culminated in the largest ever seen, most problematic to block and contain RPS DDoS attack where RPS stands for Requests Per Second.</description>

<description>This week we look at a way of protecting ourselves from Razor-mouse-like local elevation of privilege attacks. We reexamine the meaning of the phrase “Internet Anonymity” following the ProtonMail revelation. We revisit Apple's now delayed CSAM plans. We look at some new troubles for Bluetooth and at a popular and persistently unpatched residential security system which can be trivially disarmed by bad guys. We share some interesting closing the loop feedback and a new Sci-Fi discovery. Then we take a long and careful look at the details and differences between version 1.2 and 2.0 of the Trusted Platform Module specification to discover just what it is that Microsoft wants to insist is available for Windows 11.</description>

<description>This week we'll start out by clarifying the terms credit freeze and credit lock. Then we have news of the T-Mobile breach from its perpetrator. We examine the evolving and infuriating question of where will Windows 11 run and we look at yet another newly revealed attack against Microsoft's Exchange server known as ProxyToken. I wanted to clarify a bit about Tailscale's source openness, and touch on the disturbing revelations shaking the mass storage industry with SSD performance being deliberately reduced once they've been well reviewed and adopted. I'll update our patient SpinRite owners on my recent work and progress, we'll touch on some cellular phone terminology, then conclude by considering the power of the PIN and look at just how much damage it can do.</description>

<description>This week we briefly look at Firefox's plan to block unsecured downloads. We examine the threat posed by T-Mobile's massive and deep data breach and what current and past customers of T-Mobile should do. We look at three additional so-called “Overlay Networks” in addition to Tailscale, and also at the consequences of another Orange Tsai Microsoft Exchange Server exploit chain discovery. We'll also examine a simple-to-make flaw in the Razer gaming mouse installer, cover another worrisome IoT protocol screw-up, and share a couple of feedback notes and a question from our listeners. Then I want to conclude by following up on last week's discussion of Microsoft's apparent culpable negligence with a proposed explanation of their behavior and motivation which fits the facts so well that it becomes Reasoned Neglect.</description>

<description>This week we look at another very significant improvement in Firefox's privacy guarantees and the first steps for Facebook into native end-to-end encryption. We look at several well-predicted instances of abuse of Microsoft's PrintNightmare vulnerabilities, and at a clever cryptocurrency mining Botnet that optimizes the commandeered system for its own needs. We note ASUS' terrific move to help their motherboard users make the move to Windows 11, and at the merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast. Then, after touching upon a bit of errata and some closing-the-loop feedback from our terrific podcast followers, we conclude with a sober consideration of Microsoft's handling of vulnerability patching during the past year. And we ask what it means.</description>

<description>This week we look at a pervasive failure built into the random number generators of a great many, if not nearly all, lightweight IoT devices. We look at some old, new and returned critical vulnerabilities in major VPN products. And we encounter 14 fatal flaws in a widely used embedded TCP/IP stack. We look at a number of terrific bits of feedback from our listeners. Then we carefully examine the operation and consequences of Apple's recent announcement of their intention to begin reacting to the photographic image content being sent, received and stored by their iOS-based devices.</description>

<description>This week we look at FireFox's declining active user count, at the evolution of the Initial Network Access Broker world, at several different ransomware group renamings and revivals and we encounter a well-informed Active Directory security researcher who feels about Microsoft's July pretty much as we do. I want to turn our listeners onto a very interesting looking Hamachi'esque overlay for WireGuard and share a fun diagnostic anecdote that cost me a day of work last Friday. We have a bit of closing the loop feedback from a couple of our listeners, then we're going to share an interview with a member of the “maybe new or maybe rebranded” ransomware group BlackMatter which Recorded Future posted yesterday.</description>

<description>This week we will plow into another two new serious vulnerabilities brought to the industry by Microsoft named SeriousSAM and PetitPotam. But we first look at how Chrome managed to hugely speed up its Phishing website early warning system (making it even earlier). We cover the striking news of Kaseya having obtained a universal decryptor which is effective for every one of their victims, we look at the massive HP printer driver mess and consider the larger lesson that it teaches, and then we look at the new security features GitHub is bringing to its support of the "Go" language. Then, after sharing one bit of listener feedback, we plow into SeriousSAM and PetitPotam.</description>

<description>This week we look at the continuing attacks on Chrome with yet another zero-day and at Mozilla's continuing work to give their users the most privacy possible. We reexamine that iOS WiFi SSID bug and a related bug which, it turns out, Apple apparently knew was a showstopper. Amazingly, two more new problems have surfaced with Microsoft printer technology. We have a review of last week's Patch Tuesday including the importance of also updating any instances of Adobe's Acrobat and Reader. We revisit an old friend and consider the folly of rolling one's own crypto. We look at the explosive revelations surrounding the widespread abuse of iPhone and Android "surveillance-ware" produced by the NSO Group. And finally, after sharing one fun piece of errata, we're going to finish by examining the curious, sudden, complete and total disappearance of the REvil ransomware organization.</description>

<description>The past week has been dominated by the unimaginable mess that Microsoft has created with what have become multiple failed attempts to patch the two PrintNightmare flaws, and the continuing “Cleanup on Aisle 5” following what is widely regarded as the single most significant ransomware supply chain attack event ever.  So today we first catch up on the still sadly relevant PrintNightmare from which the industry has been unable to awaken.  We'll cover a few more bits of security news.  Then, as planned, we'll take a deep dive into the detailed operation of the REvil/Sodinokibi malware's cryptographic design.</description>

<description>The so-called Windows “PrintNightmare” remote code execution flaw, as bad as it is, was overshadowed by the Sodinokibi malware which the REvil ransomware gang managed to infiltrate into Kaseya, a popular provider of remote network management solutions for managed service providers. Since those MSP's all, in turn, have their own customers, the result was a multiplicative explosion in simultaneous ransomware attacks. Since those attacks reportedly numbered in excess of 1000(!), this makes it the worst ransomware event in history. So, while we'll definitely be covering the PrintNightmare and other events of the week, our topic will be the reconstruction of the timeline and details of the Kaseya Saga.</description>

<description>This week we look at the story behind an important Edge update and revisit Google's now-delayed FloC liftoff. We consider the cost of Ireland's recovery from the Conti ransomware attack, and ask who's responsible for the damage and data loss following the remote wiping of many Western Digital My Book NAS devices. We take a moment to observe the passing of an industry legend. Then, we look at the mess surrounding questions of where Windows 11 will run. I share my favorite web browser keyboard shortcut, and also my favorite web site cloning tool, which I just had the occasion to use. We have a worthwhile looking cybersecurity Humble Bundle, then we'll wrap up by responding to two pieces of closing the loop feedback from our terrific listeners. And that will bring us to the end of the first half of an event-filled 2021.</description>

<description>This week, believe it or not, we have yet another 0-day stomped out in Chrome. We also have some additional intelligence about the evolution of the ransomware threat. I also want to closely look at a curious WiFi bug that was recently discovered in iOS and what it almost certainly means about the way we're still programming today. Under our miscellany topic I want to share the SHA256 hash of the developer release .ISO of Windows 11 that Paul Thurrott, I and many others have been playing with this past week. I have a tip about creating an offline account and restoring Windows 10's traditional Start menu under Windows 11. A new purpose has also been discovered for this podcast which I want to share, and I've decided to explain in more detail than I have before what I've been doing with SpinRite's evolution - it's much more than anyone might expect - yet no more than is necessary. Then we're going to conclude with the view of ransomware from Russia, from two Russian security researchers who believe they know exactly why the Avaddon ransomware as a service decided to shutter its operations and publish its keys.</description>

Then we're going to recap last week's industry wide June patch-fest followed by looking at TikTok's controversial but unsurprising privacy policy update. We need to also cover the wonderful spy-novel'ish ANOM sting operation which lowered the boom on as many as 800 criminals. For our happily infrequent Errata section we'll challenge an apparently erroneous statement I made last week, then I want to share an interesting laptop data recovery experience which BitLocker made much more complex a few weeks ago which I think our listeners will find interesting. Then we're going to tackle this week's topic of some very troubling research which again demonstrates just how difficult it is to design robustly secure networked systems.</description>

<description>This week I want to start off with a calm rant to summarize why today's computer security is so atrocious. I think it's worth a bit of a reality check on that. Then we're going to look at a new feature in Firefox and at Firefox's apparent jump in performance. We'll touch on three new ransomware victims, look at what's been learned about how Colonial Pipeline was breached, and at the curious news that the FBI somehow managed to snatch all of DarkSide's Bitcoins. We'll look at the latest good and bad news regarding WordPress, and at Github's updated policy regarding posting proofs-of-concepts for ongoing attacks. I've finished Project Hail Mary, so I have a comment to make there, and I want to address the surprisingly controversial question of NAT vs IPv6. Then we'll wrap up by examining the question of whether password managers should be intrinsic to our browsers or extrinsic.  I think we're going to have some fun!</description>

<description>This week we begin by examining the recent advances made by the just-released Chrome 91 and revisit Google's configurable long-term activity logging. On the ransomware front we look at yet another likely addition to the ransomware ecosystem: trusted 3rd-party file decryptors. We anticipate next week's activation of the Amazon Sidewalk ultra-wide area network, look at the questionable claims of another massive cyberattack, and at WhatsApp's privacy struggles with India and Brazil – couldn't happen to nicer folks. Then we'll touch on just a single bit of trivia before plowing into a detailed examination of the operation of the newest ransomware in town: Epsilon Red.</description>

<description>This week we examine Firefox's just-released and welcome re-architecture under codename "Fission."  We look at a new and recently active ransomware player named "Conti" and at a recently paid, high-profile mega ransom.  We then ask the question, "When they say IoT, do they mean us?"  We examine the implications of a new industry term, "mean time to inventory."  We'll then lighten things up a bit with a new form of CAPTCHA and, of all things, a screensaver I discovered that I cannot take my eyes off of.  (Leo, it's not quite as bad as whatever that game is that you cannot stop playing, but still.)  We'll then share an ample helping of closing-the-loop feedback from our terrific listeners, after which I want to conclude by predicting what I would bet we're probably going to next see emerge from the evolving ransomware business model  sad though it is to utter the phrase "ransomware business model."</description>

<description>This week we follow-up on last week's “News from the Darkside” with a surprising amount of happenings including the dark web's rejection of further ransomware. We look at blockchain analytics which are used to follow the dark money, the mixed signals now coming from the Darkside group and a live list of more than 2000 ransomware attacks during the past two years from the dark web. We cover last week's Patch Tuesday that you won't want to miss. We have a bit of miscellany, including the “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force” which is actually a thing, and some closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners regarding last week's Andy Weir's “Hail Mary” book mention. Then we take a close look at the biggest non-Colonial Pipeline news from last week: a new round of research which revealed a range of attacks on WiFi's security.</description>

<description>This week we look at a new (and old) thread to our global DNS infrastructure.  We ask what the heck Google is planning with two-step verification, and we examine a huge new problem with the Internet's majority of email servers.  We look at the reality of Tor exit node insecurity, touch on a new sci-fi novel by a well-known author, share a bit of closing-the-loop feedback, then take a look at this latest very high-profile ransomware attack from a previously low-key attacker.</description>

<description>This week we begin by remembering Dan Kaminsky, who the world lost last Friday at the age of 42. We finally catch up with this month's Patch Tuesday, and look at a welcome maturation in Google's Project Zero vulnerability disclosure policy. We shine a light upon a new startup venture which, if successful, promises to dramatically improve the future of IoT security. We then look at some controversial security research, for which the researchers have apologized, and wonder whether any apology was due. We shine another light onto a new battle Cloudflare has chosen to wage against an abusive patent troll, to help Cloudflare with additional attention, and to let our listeners know that they can participate in a money-making hunt for prior art. And after a brief SpinRite progress report, we engage with the Internet mystery of the Autonomous System 8003.</description>

<description>This week we touch on the Vivaldi browser project's take on Google's FLoC.  We look at Chrome's vulnerability-driven update to v89, and then its feature-embellished move to Chrome 90.  We consider the surprising move by the FBI to remove web shells from U.S. Exchange Servers without their owners' knowledge or permission, and WordPress's consideration of FLoC Blocking.  We also have an interesting-looking programmer's Humble Bundle, some interesting closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners, and a brief progress report on SpinRite.  We finish by examining an important privacy guarantee provided by Google's FLoC implementation which prevents homogeneity attacks, where users presenting a common cohort ID also share a sensitive attribute.</description>

<description>This week we start with some needed revisiting of previous major topics.  We look at an additional remote port that Chrome will soon be blocking, and the need to change server ports if you're using it.  We look again at Google's forthcoming FLoC non-tracking technology and a new test page put up by the EFF.  We revisit the PHP GIT server hack now that it's been fully understood.  We look at Cisco's eyebrow-raising decision not to update some end-of-life routers having newly revealed critical vulnerabilities, and we also examine another instance of the industry's failure to patch  for years.  Then, we conclude with a blow-by-blow, or hack-by-hack, walkthrough of last week's quite revealing and somewhat chilling Pwn2Own competition.</description>

<description>This week, by popular demand, we examine the big cover-up at Ubiquiti.  We look at the consequences of the personal data of 533-plus million Facebook users appearing on the 'Net and how to tell if you're represented there.  We look at another water treatment plant break-in with a very different outcome.  We look at a new move by Google to further lock down Android against abuses of its permissive-by-design API services.  We look at the new threat to Call Of Duty cheaters, and yet another set of serious vulnerabilities in QNAP NAS devices.  Then, after sharing a catchy tweet, we look into some new research from researchers in Ireland into the unwarranted chattiness of iOS and Android mobile phones.</description>

<description>This week we begin by checking in on the patching progress, or lack therefore, of the ProxyLogon Exchange Server mess.  We examine a new Spectre vulnerability in Linux, a handful of high-severity flaws affecting OpenSSL, still more problems surfacing with SolarWinds code, an intriguing new offering from our friends at Cloudflare, and the encouraging recognition of the need for increasing vigilance of the security of increasingly prevalent networked APIs.  I'll check in about my work on SpinRite.  Then we're going to take a look at the often breathlessly reported hack of the PHP project's private Git server, and why I think that all the tech press got it all wrong.</description>

<description>This week we briefly, I promise, catch up with ProxyLogon news regarding Windows Defender and the Black Kingdom.  We look at Firefox's next release which will be changing its Referer header policy for the better.  We look at this week's most recent RCE disaster, a critical vulnerability in the open source MyBB forum software, and China's new CAID (China Anonymization ID).  We then conclude by taking a good look at Google's plan to replace tracking with explicit recent browsing history profiling, which is probably the best way to understand FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts).  And as a special bonus we almost certainly figure out why they named it something so awful.</description>

Some wonderful news for the Open Source community, a bit of miscellany, some listener feedback, and a screenshot of the final replacement for SpinRite's "Discovering System's Mass Storage Devices..." screen.  Then we revisit the Microsoft Exchange disaster, another week downstream and still drowning.</description>

<description>This week we look into last week's critical Chrome update and also cover the wackiest-but-true Chrome extension of all time. We look at Google's new funding of Linux security development; a surprisingly undead, long-unheard-from media player that just received a massive collection of updates; and, yes, still another way of abusing Intel's latest processor microarchitecture. We need to update everyone on our Dependency Confusion topic from two weeks back because there's big news there. We have several bits of identical listener feedback all wanting to be sure that I knew something had happened. Then we're going to cover the world's latest global crisis which we first mentioned as breaking news in the middle of last week's podcast. It was breaking then.  It's badly broken now.</description>

<description>This week we discuss a welcome change coming soon to the Chrome browser, and a welcome evolution in last week's just released Firefox 86. We're going to look at questions surrounding the source of the original intrusion into SolarWinds servers, and at a new severity-10 vulnerability affecting Rockwell Automation PLC controllers. We'll touch on VMware's current trouble with exploitation of their vCenter management system, and I want to share a recent code debugging experience I think our listeners will enjoy and find interesting. Then we're going to conclude with some information about something that's been going on quietly out of sight and under the covers which must be made as widely public among web technologists as possible.</description>

<description>This week we'll follow-up on the Android SHAREit app sale. We look at a clever new means of web browser identification and tracking and at a little mistake the Brave browser made that had big effect. I want to remind our listeners about the ubiquitous presence of tracking and viewing beacons in virtually all commercial eMail today. We'll look at Microsoft's final SolarWinds Solorigate report and at another example of the growing trend of mobile apps being sold and then having their trust abused. I'll share a post from the weekend about a dramatic improvement in SSD performance after running SpinRite, but also why you may wish to hold off on doing so yourself. And then we're going to look at what everyone will agree was -- and perhaps still is -- a breathtaking oversight in the way today's complex software products are assembled which creates an inherent massive vulnerability across the entire software industry.</description>

<description>This week we'll begin by following up on last week's headline-making attack on the Oldsmar, Florida water treatment plant with new details that have since come to light.  We'll then take a look into last week's Patch Tuesday event and at some of the sadly broken things that have once again been fixed.  Also, anyone using Adobe's PDF tools, Acrobat or Reader, needs to update.  We're going to look at a dangerous Android App with 1.8 billion (with a "b") users, and at Microsoft's note about the rise of web shells, which dovetails nicely into this week's WordPress add-on disaster.  I'll briefly update about my past eventful week with SpinRite, which includes a 25-second movie of new SpinRite code running.  Then we'll take a look at the recent discovery of the largest list of email and password combinations ever compiled, and what we can each do about it.</description>

<description>This week we begin with a collection of interesting and engaging news surrounding Google's Chrome browser.  We look at a high-profile Windows Defender misfire, and at new WordPress plugin nightmares.  We check in on the world of DDoS attacks and cover the meaning of three new critical vulnerabilities in SolarWinds software.  We have a bit of closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners, an update on my work toward the next SpinRite, and then we look at a near-miss disaster in a poorly designed industrial control system.</description>

<description>This week we examine another instance of a misbehaving certificate authority losing Chrome's trust.  We cover a number of serious new vulnerabilities including an urgent update need for the just-released Gnu Privacy Guard; another supply chain attack against end users; a disastrous 10-year-old flaw in Linux's SUDO command; and, thanks to Google, some details of Apple's quietly redesigned sandboxing of iMessage in iOS 14.  I'm going to share something that I think our listeners will find quite interesting about some recent architectural decisions for SpinRite, and then we'll conclude with a look at the inevitable improvement in NAT bypassing Slipstreaming.</description>

<description>This week we look at the updates in release 88 of both Chrome and Edge with their evolving password manager features.  We also look at two recent headshaking consequences of the hard end of life for Adobe's Flash.  Ransomware gangs have added another new incentive for payment, and additional details continue emerging about last year's SolarWinds attacks.  We have newly disclosed discoveries from a Google Project Zero researcher, and I spend a bit of time wondering out loud how we're ever going to change the low priority that's currently being given to serious security problems that don't directly inconvenience end users.  And we finish by examining a very useful analysis of the comparative security of iOS and Android recently published by Johns Hopkins' Matthew Green and team.</description>

<description>This week we look at one aspect in which Chrome and Chromium differ, and then at a bit of growth news from the DuckDuckGo folks.  Google's Project Zero reports on some terrific detective work, and we look at last week's Patch Tuesday.  There's also Microsoft's pending change to the flaws which enabled last year's Zerologon debacle, and the NSA's interesting statement about enterprises and the DoH protocol.  We look at the research that cracked the secret key out of Google's supposedly uncrackable Titan FIDO U2F dongle, and we catch up with a bit of listener feedback.  Then we wrap up by looking at various aspects of the frenzy caused by WhatsApp's quite predictable move to incorporate its users' conversation metadata into Facebook's monetization ecosystem.</description>

<description>This week we address critical updates for Firefox and all Chromium-based browsers and a potentially unwelcome, but reversible, change coming to Firefox.  We look at another new tactic being employed by ransomware gangs; an update on ransomware's profitability; a bogus-seeming announcement from Intel during yesterday's CES; and the first use, on this podcast, of the term "teledildonics."  Following that, we have some residual SolarWinds news, the formation of a security screw-up crisis management group, news of the inevitable attacks on Zyxel users, the mass exodus from WhatsApp following their plans to force all metadata sharing, and a sci-fi note about "The Expanse."  Then, inspired by the amazing amount of old code I have rediscovered inside SpinRite, I will take our listeners back to the roaring '80s with a look at how far we have come from DOS v3.3, whose maximum partition size was 33.5 megabytes.</description>

<description>This week we open the New Year taking a longer look at fewer topics since the bad guys were apparently enjoying their New Year holiday, too.  So we look at an interesting kludge that's been forced upon Chrome by ill-mannered antiviral scanners.  We need to warn all enterprise users of Zyxel network border security products of another recently discovered built-in backdoor.  We look at the rise in IoT compromise swatting attacks and a series of new flaws and vulnerabilities in the PHP Zend and Yii frameworks.  We have a quick bit of miscellany to share, then I want to explain a lot about the value of trimming SSDs and newer SMR drives.  And we'll conclude by catching up with what will hopefully be the last news, for a while at least, of the disastrous SolarWinds breach and intrusions.</description>

<description>This week, as we end 2020, we look at Chrome's backing away from a security initiative, Firefox's move to further thwart tracking, all of the browsers once again saying “No!” to Kazakhstan, the formation of a new industry-wide Ransomware Task Force, this week's widespread WordPress security disaster, the return of Treck's insecure embedded TCP/IP stack, and yes... finally, the long awaited announcement of the release of the ReadSpeed benchmark which serves as a testbed and proof-of-operation for the next generation of SpinRite. And then we look at everything more that has come to light three weeks downstream from the first revelations of the SolarWinds-based massively widespread network intrusion and compromise.</description>

<description>This week is crammed with news leading up to our holiday break.  Chrome is throttling ads.  There's new cross-browser as insertion malware.  We have a new term in the ransomware world.  We have last week's Patch Tuesday, a jaw-dropping policy leak from Microsoft, trouble for Cisco's Jabber, an embarrassing vulnerability in many D-Link VPN servers, the brief Google outage, more horrific news of IoT network stack vulnerabilities, another WordPress mess, the 2020 Pwnie Awards, the welcome end-of-life of Flash, JavaScript's 25th birthday and free instruction classes, a bit of closing the loop, and SpinRite news.  Then we take a full reconnaissance dive into what happened with the monumental and in so many ways horrific SolarWinds supply chain security breach.</description>

<description>At the beginning of this podcast, you're going to receive some details about another update to Chrome, and news of a few new high-profile ransomware victims.  You'll learn about a breathtaking, remotely exploitable zero-click complete iPhone security compromise, as well as another significant big step forward for DNS privacy beyond DoH.  We'll explain the nature of another serious and probably lingering problem within many Android apps.  I have a few interesting bits of miscellany and SpinRite news to share.  And before this is over, you will have obtained a full working sense for exactly what it is that Amazon has created and why, with their Amazon Sidewalk neighborhood IoT network concept, coming soon to all of your Amazon devices.</description>

<description>This week we look at a couple of new and forthcoming Chrome features.  I'll quickly run though some new and notable ransomware casualties, including a couple of follow-ups.  We'll look at a critical flaw in the Drupal content management system, the big trouble with generic smart doorbells, an interesting attack on Tesla Model X key fobs, CA's adaptation to single-year browser certs, several instances of leaked credential archives, a critical RCE in a major MDM server, a bit about the Salvation Trilogy, and some extremely promising news about SpinRite's future.  Then we'll wrap up by taking a look at the consequences of the increasing consolidation of DNS service providers.  It's not good if staying on the Internet is important to you.</description>

<description>This week we have a bunch of news on both the Chrome and Firefox fronts with patches, updates, and new features.  We have a comical bit of news from the ransomware front, and more troubling ongoing WordPress attack specifics, including a weird eCommerce site spoofing attack.  We look at the future consequences of ongoing vulnerability announcements coupled with their very incomplete patching, and Android's bold move right into the middle of the unbreakable end-to-end encryption controversy.  And then we'll conclude with a look at a large, multiyear (as in 11-year) advanced very-persistent threat state-based attack perpetrator known as "Cicada."</description>

<description>This week the Chrome zero-days just keep on coming, and we contemplate what it means for the future.  We have two interesting bits of ransomware meta news including a new tactic.  We update after last week's Super Tuesday patch marathon, and examine new research into the most common source of Android malware to see where most unwanted apps come from  and it's not what we would likely guess.  We'll share a bit of listener feedback and an update on my work on SpinRite.  Then we look at the new "SAD DNS" attack which successfully regresses us 12 years in DNS cache poisoning and spoofing attack prevention.</description>

<description>This week we examine a recently patched zero-day in Chrome and a nice new feature in that browser.  We look at the site isolation coming soon to Firefox, and Microsoft's announcement of Edge for Linux.  We have some movement in the further deprecation of Internet Explorer, and a potentially massive SQL injection attack that was recently dodged by more than one million WordPress sites, despite the fact that some admins complained.  Then we have a bit of miscellany, closing-the-loop feedback, and an update on my work on SpinRite.  We end by looking at the NSA's recently published list of the top 25 network vulnerabilities being used by malicious Chinese state actors to attack U.S. assets.</description>

<description>This week we examine the coming controversial changes to the WebExtension API. We look at the revelations and fallout from last week's Patch Tuesday, and at Zoom's latest announcement of this week's roll-out of end-to-end encryption. We make sure everyone knows about the latest horrific SonicWall vulnerability and Microsoft's pair of not-that-worrisome out-of-cycle patches. We share a bit of miscellany and closing-the-loop feedback. Then we examine an actual Ryuk Ransomware intrusion and attack... step-by-step.</description>

<description>This week we catch up with Chrome 86's handful of security-related improvements.  We touch on several recent ransomware events and on the consequences of not logging free WiFi users in France.  We look at the results of an amazing bit of hacking of Apple, give an update on the enduring Zerologon threat, introduce the revenge of DNT with legislation-enhanced GPC, and describe another renewed attack on undecryptable E2EE now by seven countries.  Then, following a bit of SpinRite and GRC forum news, we're going to add the concept of IANA-registered well-known URIs to our bag-of-tricks knowledgebase.</description>

<description>This week we examine several new and welcome Google initiatives aimed at improving Android general web browser security. We look at Microsoft's solution for updating aging Windows offline images with the latest Defender definitions. We note some surprising network behavior from Windows second Subsytem for Linux. We check-in on Exchange Server updates after eight months. We cover Cloudflare's announcement of a very welcome WebAPI firewall, the US Treasury's recent policy regarding Ransomware payments, and Kaspersky's discovery of the use of UEFI Bootkits. Then we have a bit of errata and a GRC forums update. And we conclude by sharing the results of an interesting poll which illuminates the many reasons why Windows 7 refuses to die.</description>

<description>This week we look back at the just-released Chrome 85.  We see that an enterprise's choice of VPN gateway really does make a difference.  We drop in for an update on what would have to be called the new ransomware gold rush, and we examine the implications of Ring's latest announcement of their flying spy drone  I mean webcam.  Then we learn how much Vitamin D Dr. Fauci takes, and invite our podcast listeners to lock down their UserID of choice at GRC's new web forums using a non-public URL.  Then we conclude with the required big update to the Zerologon story which we began last week.</description>

<description>This week we look at an important security update to Android for Firefox.  We bid a fond farewell to Firefox Send and Notes.  We look at the promise and growing popularity of the disastrously-named DuckDuckGo Internet search service.  We dig into what's behind last Friday's Emergency Directive 20-04 from the DHS/CISA.  We'll also take a look at the recent privacy and security improvements incorporated into Android 11 and iOS 14.  We have a bit of errata, closing-the-loop feedback, and SpinRite news.  Then we're going to take a look at the need for Formal Verification of our complex security protocols going forward in the context of another critical failure of a massively widespread system.</description>

We also look at the last hurrah for exploiting IE and Adobe Flash users, some Microsoft Edge updates, last Tuesday's Microsoft Patch-a-Palooza, Zoom's new implementation of two- factor authentication, that very bad WordPress File Manager attack two weeks out, the new Raccoon attack against TLS, and a quick SpinRite update.  Then we conclude with a look at two newly discovered attacks named BlindSide and BLURtooth.</description>

<description>This week we take some deeper dives into fewer topics. We look at a bunch of the new features offered by Chrome's latest update, we look into the fascinating details of a Russian attempt to co-opt and bribe an employee of Tesla, and at some sobering security research which successfully circumvents VISA's point of sale PIN protection, allowing purchases of any amount. We also have a bunch of closing-the-loop feedback and miscellany. Then we examine the surprising research into just how well knowing where our browser has gone in the past identifies who we are today. Knowing what someone did last summer tells us who they are with surprising accuracy.</description>

<description>This week we note the completion of the first virtual Black Hat and Defcon conferences. We also examine the latest academic work to emerge from the Graz University, which dramatically advances our understanding of the past few years of performance optimizing processor vulnerabilities. We look at the ransomware attack on Canon, a mishandled vBulletin vulnerability disclosure, the forthcoming support for DoH on Windows 10, and the result of Troy Hunt's yearlong quest to find a home for his much-loved "Have I Been Pwned" services. We have a bit of miscellany, some feedback, and an update on my SpinRite work. Then we examine a very interesting new technology being used to evade state-based Internet censorship known as "Geneva."</description>

We have more information about the Garmin ransomware hack.  We look at the behavior of another disgruntled vulnerability researcher and consider another aspect of the ethics of vulnerability disclosure.  We examine Zoom's bug of the week and the consequences of Microsoft's removal of all SHA-1 signed downloads, and note that QNAP NAS devices are still suffering from real trouble and neglect by their owners.  I'm going to check in with the SpinRite work.  Then we take a look at the week's biggest security event - the discovery of a boot security bypass for Linux.</description>

<description>This week we, of course, start off by looking at what happened at Twitter last week. We look at Checkpoint's discovery of the headline-grabbing wormable DNS vulnerability that's been present in all Windows Servers for the past 17 years. We touch on last week's Patch Tuesday, Cloudflare's surprise outage, another glitch in Zoom's product, and seven "no-logging" VPN providers whose logs were all found online. We cover some other quick news and some interesting SpinRite development developments, then examine the problem of counterfeit networking equipment - which, as our Picture of the Week shows, is actually a big problem.</description>

Then we wrap up by looking at Tsunami, Google's latest and extremely useful-looking contribution to the open source community.</description>

<description>This week we look at two new just-released emergency Windows 10 updates, and the new and curious path they will need to take to get to their users.  We look at a slick new privacy feature coming to iOS 14 and how it is already cleaning up prior behavior.  We'll take our annual survey of the rapidly growing success of the HackerOne program, and also note the addition of a major new participant in their bug bounty management program.  We briefly note the latest American city to ban the use of facial recognition for law enforcement, but we mostly examine the result of NIST's analysis of demographic bias in facial recognition outcomes.  We'll also look at a high-velocity vulnerability and exploitation, and close the loop with a couple of listeners.  I'll share an interesting bit of work on SpinRite's AHCI controller benchmarking.  Then we'll look at this episode's mysterious title:  "123456."</description>

<description>This week we look at news in the shortening of certificate lifetime change, at Apple's decision to deliberately ignore support for a bunch of new Web APIs, at Apple's announcement of DoH support, at some troubling Mozilla/Comcast news, at some welcome legislation to head off the use of facial recognition, and at another less welcome attempt to outlaw strong encryption.  We also look at the growing legislation against mandatory "chipping" and remind our listeners about the utility of VirusTotal.  Then, after catching up with a bit of miscellany and listener feedback, we revisit last week's very worrisome revelation of the many flaws in a very widely used embedded TCP/IP stack.  There's much news there.</description>

<description>This week we look at Microsoft's interesting decision to update Windows 7 desktops with their new Edge browser, Google's wholesale removal of 106 widely-downloaded malicious Chrome extensions, Microsoft's continuing drama over Win10 printing, a potentially critical remote code execution vulnerability in everyone's favorite VLC media player, an interesting move by RosKomNadZor!, Netgear's residence in the Dog House, a new and startling record in DDoS attack size, a bit of errata and the anticipated announcement of a new piece of spin-off freeware from the SpinRite project. Then we examine the ripple effects of the mass adoption of a embedded TCP/IP stack that is found to be horribly insecure many years after it has been quite widely adopted across the embedded device industry.</description>

<description>This week we address an accident that the Brave browser guys regret.  We take a look at last week's Patch Tuesday and its several ramifications and consequences.  We note a few odd new and unwelcome behaviors from this year's 2004 Win10 feature update and dip into yet another side-channel attack on Intel chips.  But we also note that a long-awaited powerful antimalware technology is also about to ship from Intel.  We look at the latest new SMB vulnerability named SMBleed, and conclude with an examination of the latest and more-practical-than-most techniques for covertly eavesdropping on a remote location - via a hanging light bulb.</description>

<description>This week we take an interesting new look at some new problems arising with DoH; we look at IBM's new stance on facial image recognition research; we look at two recently disclosed flaws in the Zoom client; we check on the severity of the latest UPnP service flaw; and we update on Microsoft's new Edge rollout.  We share a bit of miscellany and some terrific feedback from our listeners, touch on my SpinRite project progress, and then explore last week's truly confusing Zoom encryption reports that give the term "mixed messaging" a bad name.</description>

Then we take a look at Zoom's newly detailed plans to become the world's most secure teleconferencing platform.</description>

<description>This week we begin with some browser news to examine a nifty new trick to be offered by the next Firefox 77 and we spend a bunch of time on the many new features -- and how to enable them -- being offered in Chrome's 83rd edition. We also look at Adobe's four emergency out-of-cycle patches, and a surprisingly robust and well designed new Jailbreak for iPhones. We take a look at a surprisingly powerful DNS amplification attack with a packet count multiplier of up to 1620, the sad but true complete collapse of Bluetooth connection security and the odd report of eBay scanning their user's PC's. We'll then share a bit of closing the loop listener feedback and a quick bit of miscellany, then I'm going to editorialize a bit about why I'm very sure that contact tracking apps are dead on arrival.</description>

<description>We begin this week as we often do on the third Tuesday with a look at the previous week's Patch Tuesday; and, in this case, a troubling new trend is emerging.  We look at the DoH support coming soon to Windows 10, and at a little known packet capture utility that was quietly added to Windows 10 with the October 2018 feature update.  We'll spend a bit of time on yesterday's DOJ/FBI press conference, and then take a look at a problem that Microsoft appears to be having a surprising time resolving.  We'll take a look at face masks thwarting automated public facial recognition, and Utah's decision to roll their own contact tracing and locating app.  And we'll wind up with what I hope will be an interesting walk through the history of Ethernet, from the beginning of wired to the evolution of the many confusing wireless protocols.</description>

<description>This week we examine Firefox's recent move to 76 and slightly beyond; a wonderful new feature coming to Edge; and the security responsibility that attends the use of WordPress, vBulletin, and other complex and sophisticated web applications. We look at the plans for this summer's much-anticipated Black Hat and DEF CON conferences, a newly revealed CRITICAL bug affecting all of the past six years of Samsung Smartphones, and Zoom's latest security-boosting acquisition. I'll then provide an update on my SpinRite work which includes a bit of a rearrangement in sequence to provide another shorter term deliverable. And then we look at the new Thunderspy vulnerability that has the tech press huffing and puffing.</description>

We then share a bit of errata, miscellany and SpinRite news, then take a look at China's proposed changes to the fundamental operation of our global Internet.</description>

<description>This week we update on the Apple/Google contact tracing technology. We also take a close look at the past week's frenzy over two newly disclosed vulnerabilities in iOS's mail application. We consider the choice of VPN provider relative to expanding global surveillance agreements. And we look at some recently spotted dangers of public repositories. We have a bit of miscellany, a SpinRite update and some useful feedback from a listener regarding Oracle's VirtualBox VM system. Then we wrap up the week with a look into RPKI, Resource Public Key Infrastructure for finally bringing some security to BGP, the Internet's critical Border Gateway Protocol.</description>

We have two pieces of Chrome browser news, and security news including what happened with last Tuesday's Windows patch, rollbacks in authentication plans, Signal's reaction to the planned EARN IT Act, trouble at the Tor Project and an interesting CAPTCHA change at Cloudflare. I also want to share my recent change in preferred VM systems, two bits of listener's closing the loop feedback, and a SpinRite update -- since stuff's beginning to happen.</description>

<description>This week we follow-up on a bunch of continuing Zoom news, since Zoom appears to be poised to become the teleconferencing platform of choice for the world at large. They've made more changes, have been sued and have been rapidly taking steps to fix their remaining problems. We have some browser news and another worrisome look into Android apps using a novel approach to quickly characterize them. We have an interesting and sad bit of miscellany and a progress report on my SpinRite work, and then we take the sort of full technical deep dive into the joint Apple/Google Contact Tracing system that our listeners have come to expect from this podcast. By the end of this podcast everyone will understand exactly what Apple and Google have done and how the system functions, in detail.</description>

<description>This week starts off with a bunch of web browser news including Firefox zero-days, Safari's recent scrape, more coronavirus-related feature rollbacks, the status of TLS v1.0 and 1.1, and some interesting developments on the Edge front.  We revisit the lingering STIR and SHAKEN telco protocol mess, then look at a new DNS-filtering add-on service from Cloudflare and at the growing influence of an Internet group hoping to tighten up the mess with BGP.  After a quick update on my SpinRite project, we take a look at what's been going on with the security of Zoom, the suddenly chosen tool for hosting Internet virtual classrooms and meetings of all kinds.</description>

<description>This week we examine some consequences of increased telecommuting with the use of RDP and VPNs skyrocketing, along with a new bug in iOS's handling of VPN connections.  We look at Google's unrelenting quest to get the "www" out, and note some changes to Firefox and further revisions of browser release schedules.  We take a deep dive into a very welcome forthcoming code security feature for Windows 10.  We share an action item for users of OpenWRT routers, and the result of an audit of Cloudflare's privacy-enforcing DNS service.  We divulge a few interesting bits of feedback and some SQRL and SpinRite miscellany, then finish by examining a new opportunity to donate our unused CPU cycles for help with COVID-19 research.</description>

<description>This week we look at a new unpatched zero-day attack affecting billions of Windows users, Mozilla's reversal on TLS 1.0 and 1.1 deprecation due to the coronavirus, a welcome micropatch for Win7 and Server 2008, Chrome's altered release schedule during the coronavirus, Avast's latest screw-up, a new threat affecting Android users, the results from last week's Pwn2Own competition, and a few observations about the coronavirus math and some worthwhile explainer videos. Then we look at where we are with Rowhammer after six years.</description>

<description>This week we take a deep dive into the many repercussions preceding and following last week's Patch Tuesday. Wouldn't it be nice to have a quiet one for a change?  But first, we look at a nice list of free services being maintained by BleepingComputer's Lawrence Abrams. We look at a recent report into the state of open source software vulnerabilities, and at new and truly despicable legislation aimed at forcing social media companies to provide "lawful access" to their customers' encrypted content.</description>

<description>This week we consider the new time-limited offers being made for free telecommuting tools, the continuing success of the DOD's "please come hack us" program, another take on the dilemma and reality of Android device security, some unwelcome news about AMD processor side-channel vulnerabilities, a new potentially serious and uncorrectable flaw in Intel processors, a 9.8-rated critical vulnerability in Linux system networking, a "stand back and watch the fireworks" forced termination of TLS v1.0 and v1.1, and the evolution of the SETI@home project after 19 years of distributed radio signal number crunching. We then touch on a bit of miscellany, and finish by looking at a new and open initiative launched by Google to uniformly benchmark the performance of security fuzzers.</description>

<description>This week we reexamine the Windows 10 lost profiles problem, and also a consequence of the need to roll back (or avoid in the first place) the Patch Tuesday disaster.  We look at a new feature to arrive with the next Windows 10 feature release, unfortunately named the 2004 release.  We also examine the details of a new attack on the 4G LTE and 5G cellular technology, the full default rollout of Firefox's support for DoH, and also the availability of a powerful new sandboxing technology for Firefox.  We also check in with Chrome's fix earlier today of a zero-day that was found being exploited in the wild.  And, finally, before turning our attention to the bomb that Apple dropped in the lap of the entire certificate industry last week, I'm going to update our listeners about the things I've learned after returning to the work on SpinRite's next iteration.</description>

<description>This week we continue following the continuing agony surrounding this month's increasingly troubled Window Update.  We examine several significant failures which have befallen Windows 10 users after applying the month's "fixes," which have had the tendency of breaking things that weren't broken in the first place.  We look at the danger presented by a very popular GDPR-compliance add-in for WordPress sites.  We look at an eye-opening report about the stresses that CISOs are being subjected to, and also today's pilot test of Microsoft's new ElectionGuard voting system.  We then touch on some SQRL and SpinRite news before taking a close look at two newly revealed IoT - Internet of Troubles - security worries.</description>

<description>This week we examine the most recent flaw found in Intel's processors and what it means.  We look at the continually moving target that is Windows 10.  We consider the Free Software Foundation's suggestion that Microsoft open source Windows 7 and the fact that last month's was apparently NOT the last update of Windows 7 for all non-ESU users.  We look at the evolution of exploitation of the Remote Desktop Gateway flaw, Google's record breaking vulnerability bounty payouts, the return of Roskomnadzor, the size of fines, the question of who owns our biometrics, an update on Avast/AVG spying, the future of third-party AV, a major milestone for the WireGuard VPN, and the wonderful Little Red Wagon hack of the decade which titled this podcast.</description>

We also cover a Microsoft cloud database mistake, some interesting legislation under consideration in New York, new attacks against a consumer router firmware, a rise of new attacks against our browsers, a welcome new publication from NIST on Privacy, a massive leakage of telnet usernames and passwords, a welcome micropatch for this month's IE zero-day, a bit of miscellany and SpinRite news, and then some coverage of the final nail that was recently pounded into SHA-1's coffin.</description>

<description>This week's Security Now! podcast is titled "Windows 7 - R.I.P.," not because there's much that we haven't already said about the fact, but that it happens TODAY; and that, given the still massive install base of Windows 7, it's significant that all of those machines will now be going without any clearly needed security updates.  So the big news for this week WAS to be the event of the first successful preimage attack on the SHA-1 hash.  But that news was preempted at the last minute by the much more immediately significant news of the remotely exploitable "Cable Haunt" vulnerability that's present in most of the world's cable modems right now!  So we'll be talking about that after we look at the FBI's recent request to have Apple unlock another terrorist's iPhone; update on the Checkrain jailbreak solution; examine the challenge of checking for illegal images while preserving privacy; look at some deeply worrying research into just how easy it is for bad guys to get SIMs swapped; examine the consequences of not patching a bad VPN flaw; deal with a bit of miscellany; and then, finally, look at the new "Cable Haunt" vulnerability.</description>

We also take a precautionary lesson from a big Xiaomi blunder, examine Microsoft's research into brute-forcing RDP, look at the continuing problem at the Point Of Sale, follow-up on Russia's plan to disconnect from the Internet, consider the end of life of Python 2.7, review the top 20 HackerOne bounty payers, warn of some bad new SQLite security vulnerabilities and cover a bit of Sci-Fi, SQRL and SpinRite miscellany. Then we group all malware into a seven-member Lexicon and quickly run through each one.</description>

<description>This week we stumble into Microsoft's own confusion about whether or not Microsoft's Security Essentials will continue receiving updates after January 14th. We look briefly at the year when Ransomware happened, we revisit the Avast and AVG Mozilla extensions to see how they're doing, we look at the just-announced big news for Apple's and Google's bug bounty programs for 2020, and also at Mozilla's addition of another very appealing DoH provider (which Leo apparently likes). We provide a nudge to Drupal site masters to update their Drupal Cores RIGHT NOW... And then we conclude by revisiting this past decade -- spanning 2010 to 2019 -- and the many hacks we've explored during these previous ten years.</description>

<description>This week we start with a reminder about Google's still operating SensorVault, we look inside Google's new "Verified SMS" Messages feature, examine another salvo in the end-to-end encryption war, a nice authentication feature added to iOS v13.3, some patch Tuesday news, a startling discovery about the weaknesses of RSA at scale, a collection of quick bits about last Friday the 13th, Mozilla 2FA for add-on developers, the surprising hard out for Microsoft's Security Essentials, and two bits about Chrome 79. Then we have a clarification about last week's VPN-geddon Denied discussion, a significant announcement about my new focus, some SQRL news... and then we conclude with a look at yet another interesting new way of compromising Intel processors known as "PlunderVolt".</description>

<description>This week we look at Microsoft's force-feeding of Windows 10 feature updates, the creation of a tool to keep Win7 and 8 updates freely flowing for free, the continuing evolution of a new highly secure programming language, an update to Microsoft's RDP client for iOS, Avast and AVG in the doghouse, some VERY severe authentication bypasses in OpenBSD, and a note about the WireGuard VPN.  Then we take a look at the report which every security website breathlessly covered - and got wrong.</description>

<description>This week we revisit free upgrades from Win7 or 8 to 10 (which can still be done, a alert for users of HP SSDs, the complications which arise with international privacy treaties when end-to-end encryption might be threatened, the US government's formal permission to hack, a quick look at a particularly devastating Ransomware attack, more anti-tracking privacy happiness coming soon, by default, to Firefox, the never-ending headaches caused by Windows DLLs, an update on my "Joy of Sync" determinations, and a look at the way some Android multitasking features can and are being actively abused -- with Google's knowledge.</description>

<description>This week we look at some interesting changes coming to Android and some inherent challenges presented by the nature of the Android ecosystem.  We examine some newly revealed troubles with the venerable VNC clients and servers.  We note a welcome change to Twitter and update on law enforcement's "foregone conclusion" strategy to force password divulgence.  We then look at a surprising pre-announcement from Microsoft about DNS, then dig more deeply into the details of the emerging DoH protocol and reveal a VERY interesting and surprising and unsuspected capability.</description>

<description>This week we look back at November's Patch Tuesday while we count down to the impending end of patches for Windows 7 and Server 2008.  We check in with CheckM8 and Checkra.in as the iOS bootrom exploit continues to mature.  We look at GitHub's announcement launch of "GitHub Security Lab" to bring bounties and much stronger security focus to the open source community.  We discuss a recent court ruling regarding U.S. border entry device searches.  We cover yet another bad WhatsApp remote code execution vulnerability.  We examine the impact of version 2 of ZombieLoad, the formation of the Bytecode Alliance, and a bit of media miscellany.  Then we examine the impact of two Trusted Platform Module (TPM) failings, one which allows local key extraction, and a second that can be exploited remotely over a network.</description>

<description>This week we check in on the developments of the long-term, now working, full consumer jailbreak of iOS devices from the iPhone 4S through the iPhone X.  We examine the strange case of the misbehaving transducer, catch up on the rapidly evolving exploitation of the BlueKeep vulnerability, check out Mozilla's rebuttal to Comcast's attack on DoH, examine the surprising state of web browser support for DoH, and remind Linux and BSD users to refresh their distros after an important flaw was disclosed in a widely used archive library.  Then we take a deep dive into the operation of a newly announced forthcoming solution and standard for significantly improving TLS website certificate security known as "TLS Credential Delegation."</description>

<description>This week we examine a widespread Windows breakage introduced by last month's patch Tuesday. We look at several things Google changed in their just-released Chrome 78, news from the Edge, the status of attacks on Intel chips, a new attack on publicly-exposed QNAP NAS devices, the significant risk of trusting managed service providers, the downside of apps for autos, and worries over Chinese made drones. We then finish by coming back to look at news on two other fronts: The escalating controversy over DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and the commencement of the long-awaited BlueKeep vulnerability attacks.</description>

We also have a piece of SQRL news and some miscellany. Then we look at the outcome of a recent appellate court decision which complicates the decision about whether using a password or a biometric is more "judgment proof."</description>

We also look at a very serious flaw that was just found in Linux's Realtek WiFi driver and some welcome news from Yubico. We touch on a couple of miscellaneous media tidbits, then take a look at the ramifications of two recent biometric authentication failures and consider the challenges and inherent tradeoffs of biometric authentication.</description>

<description>This week we take a look at a sobering supply chain proof-of-concept attack, an update on the ongoing encryption debate, a blast-from-the-past password decryption, an intriguing security and privacy consequence of today's high-resolution consumer cameras, and the sad state of consumer security knowledge. OpenPGP gets a nice boost, Windows Defender gets Tamper Protection, and SQRL gets a very nice mention by Google's Cloud Security architects. We'll share a bit of sci-fi and fun miscellany, then conclude by examining the crucially important, widely available, and completely unpatchable Apple Boot ROM exploit known as "CheckM8."</description>

<description>With this week's "The Joy of Sync" podcast, we focus upon the latest state-of-the-art secure solutions for cross-device, cross-location device synchronization.  But before we delve into that abyss, we'll update on Mozilla's recently announced plans to gradually and carefully bring DNS-over-HTTPS to all Firefox users in the U.S.  It turns out it's not quite the slam dunk that we might imagine.  We'll also check in with the EFF to see what they think, and remind our listeners about the 100% free VPN offering coming from our friends at Cloudflare.</description>

<description>This week we look at the driver behind this summer's comeback in cryptocurrency mining.  We also check out a managed security provider's summary of the biggest problems they encounter with their more than 4000 clients.  We look at the revised and worrisome update after six years of SOHO router and NAS device security, and we suggest that everyone using Chrome go to Help &gt; About.  I found three notes about SpinRite that I'm not sure I ever shared, so I will.  Then we conclude with the result of processing the massive CVE vulnerability database which reveals the top 25 most enduring classes of software bug impacting the security of our industry.</description>

We also look at recent changes to Chrome 77 and the forthcoming Chrome 78, the already compromised iOS 13.0, and Mozilla Firefox's new browser VPN offering.  We take a look back at last Tuesday's Patch Tuesday, take note of Chrome's Remote Desktop feature, cover another serious Exim mail server problem, handle a bit of miscellany, and examine a serious vulnerability affecting essentially ALL smartphone users known as “Simjacker.”</description>

We also take a look at Google's Project Zero revelation of a comprehensive multiyear campaign aimed at iOS visitors to specific websites. Then we conclude with a distressingly large array of news from the ransomware front. We figure out how to pronounce Sodinokibi (so-dee'-no-kee-bee) and ponder the future of ransomware.</description>

<description>This week we check in on Texas, and on the Kazakhstan government's attempt to be their own CA. How did that work out for them? We note a troubling increase in attacks on the open source software supply chain. Google's announced plans to add data breach notification to Chrome. We look at a surprising Apple iOS v12.4 regression (whoops!) and at another Microsoft RDP component in need of updating. I update our listeners on the state of SQRL (another of its documents is completed) and on SQRL presentations past and future. I share some news from my ongoing file sync journey. We conclude by looking at some very interesting and promising moves as browser-based advertising matures from the ad hoc mess it has always been into a privacy-respecting Internet citizen.</description>

<description>This week we look at last week's monthly Patch Tuesday and its collision with third-party AV add-ons. We examine four years of Kaspersky unique web user tracking. We look again at Tavis Ormandy's discovery of the secret undocumented CTF protocol, wondering WTF is CTF? We note a new and devastating strategy in the ransomware battle which hit Texas last Friday. We also have the sad demise of Extended Validation certificates, the further removal of FTP support from web browsers, Google's campaign to still further reduce web certificate lifetimes, and Netflix's discovery of eight implementation flaws in the new HTTP/2 protocol. We'll cover a bit of miscellany, update on my file syncing journey, touch on SQRL news and SpinRite, then conclude with a look at the most recent attack on Bluetooth pairing negotiation which renders all Bluetooth associations vulnerable to a trivial attack.</description>

<description>This week, as expected, we look at some of the events and announcements from last week's Black Hat and DEF CON conference events. Microsoft and Apple have upped the ante for bug hunters, the Chaos Computer Club shreds a hotel's door lock security, a serious philosophical design flaw is revealed to be present in 40 signed device drivers, and Google vows to continue its Incognito-mode battle. We also have some SQRL news, some fun miscellany, and some interesting closing-the-loop feedback from our terrific listeners.</description>

<description>This week we look at a widespread false alarm about Facebook's planned subversion of end-to-end encryption, still more municipality ransomware attacks, more anti-encryption saber-rattling among the Five Eyes nations, Microsoft's discovery of Russian-backed IoT compromise for enterprise intrusion, Chrome 76's changes, this week's Black Hat and DEF CON conferences, a bit of miscellany, and closing the loop with our listeners.  Then I want to share my recent experiences and findings about the challenge of synchronizing a working set of files between two locations, and the tools I settled on.</description>

We look at what's popular with the underground, give an update on the latest four new ransomware attacks, examine three different attacks on exposed network attached storage (NAS) servers, cover a bit of miscellany, then take a close look at the news of the just-released-yesterday vulnerabilities in the two billion-strong VxWorks embedded OS.</description>

<description>This week we start off with something bad that we unfortunately saw coming.  We then look at the changing security indication feedback in browsers; the challenge of keeping browsers compatible with important but non-standards-compliant websites; the failure and repair of incognito browsing mode; the possibility of a forthcoming "super incognito mode" for Firefox; a new super-fast TLS stack written in the Rust programming language; Microsoft's promised open source release of their voting machine election software; and yet another widely deployed, exposed, and exploitable Internet server. We have a quick bit of miscellany and some terrific SQRL news. Then we look at a recent and quite sobering report from Sophos about attacks on exposed RDP servers.</description>

<description>This week we cover a few bullet points from last Tuesday's monthly Windows patches, as well as some annoyance that the patches caused for Windows 7 users. We track some interesting ongoing ransomware news and look at the mixed blessing of fining companies for self-reporting breaches. We check out a survey of enterprise malware headaches, update some Mozilla/Firefox news, and examine yet another (and kind of obvious) way of exfiltrating information from a PC. We address a bit of errata, some miscellany, and closing-the-loop feedback with our listeners. We then conclude with a closer look at all the progress that's been occurring quietly with DNS encryption.</description>

<description>This week we stumble over a number of instances where technology appears to be colliding with the status quo.  In any complex social system, individual and group interests are often complex and may be in opposition.  So when new technology comes along to offer new capabilities, not everyone is going to be pleased.  So this week we discuss some of the mounting tensions being created by connectivity, storage, and computation which are being combined to create many new capabilities.  We look at the surprising backlash to Mozilla's privacy-enhancing DNS-over-HTTPS support, concerns over the use of facial recognition and automobile license plate scanners, and the future of satellite-based Internet services.  We present some SQRL news and share a bunch of closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners.  We then examine how a Ruby code repository was hacked and look at the U.K. GCHQ's proposal for adding "ghost" participants into private conversations.</description>

<description>This week we track further occurrences of ransomware in Florida and elsewhere.  We check in on the state of the "going dark" anti-encryption debate.  We look at a stunning new BlueKeep proof-of-concept demo produced by the guys at SophosLabs.  We update some miscellany and present some closing-the-loop feedback from our terrific listeners.  Then we examine the nature of the continuing problem of massive publicly exposed databases.  In the third example of this just this week, we discover a prolific Chinese IoT manufacturer who is logging more than a million of their customers' devices into an exposed database of two-billion-plus records - which returns us to the dilemma we have with the utter lack of oversight and control over our own IoT devices, and the need to soberly reconsider what "IoT" stands for.</description>

<description>This week we check in on the state of last week's Linux TCP SACK kernel panic, examine two Mozilla zero-days which were being used against Coinbase and others, and note that performing a full factory reset of an IoT device may not be sufficient.  We look at a very clever and elegant solution to OpenSSH key theft via Rowhammer attacks, share an update on the BlueKeep RDP vulnerability, and examine the cause of a three-hour widespread Internet outage yesterday morning.  We discuss NASA's APT, which crawled in via a Raspberry Pi, the cost of paying versus not paying a ransomware ransom, and an update on Microsoft's Chromium-based Edge browser.  Lastly, we handle a bit of listener feedback, then take a closer look at the state of the commercial bug bounty business.</description>

<description>There were several significant stories this week. We have a new DRAM problem called "RAMBleed," news of a Linux server kernel-crashing flaw in TCP, and the occurrence of the expected attacks on Exim email servers - not to mention last week's Patch Tuesday, a Bluetooth surprise, and another useless warning about the BlueKeep vulnerability. Microsoft missed a 90-day Tavis Ormandy deadline. We have a good-news GandCrab wrap-up, Yubico's entropy mistake, a bit of post-announce SQRL news, and a favorite iOS security app. We selected as our title story the attacks on Exim mail servers so that we can talk about the other disasters, which are still pending, next week!</description>

<description>This week we catch up with the continuing antics of SandboxEscaper.  We give an update on the status of the still-not-yet-widely-exploited BlueKeep vulnerability, and also look at a new botnet which is pounding on RDP servers (but not yet using BlueKeep).  The FBI has issued an interesting advisory about not trusting secure sites just because they're secure, so we'll examine that.  The popular VideoLAN player receives an important update thanks to an interesting source, Microsoft's Edge browser takes another step forward, and Mozilla reorganizes a bit.  Then I'm going to share my must-have Utility of the Week, a just-released sci-fi movie on Netflix, and a bit of closing-the-loop feedback from the Twitterverse which resulted from my, as planned, first formal full release of SQRL.  We'll close with a look at the critical need for anyone running the Exim mail server to update immediately.</description>

<description>This week we check in on the BlueKeep RDP vulnerability.  We look at the planned shutdown of one of the, if not THE, most successful, if one can call it that, affiliate-based ransomware systems.  We update you on the anti-robocalling problem and then look at the recent announcements by the Russian and Chinese militaries about their plans to move away from the Microsoft Windows OS.  We also look at Apple's announcement yesterday of their forthcoming "Sign in with Apple" service, touch on the state of SQRL, and then share a bit of fun feedback from a listener.  We finish by examining the interesting details behind a significant old-school persistent campaign, the Nansh0u campaign, apparently sourced from China, which has successfully compromised many tens of thousands of servers exposed to the Internet.</description>

<description>This week we primarily focus upon the almost certainly impending doom of the Internet, as the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol saga finishes out its second week with a great deal of news and new evidence-based expectation for the end of humanity as we have known it.  Okay, well, maybe it won't be quite that dramatic, but it already makes last year's Meltdown and Spectre flaws seem quaint.  But before we get to that, we take a look at the FIVE new zero-day exploits just dropped by SandboxEscaper, Google's discovery and confession of 14 years of cleartext password storage, Microsoft's just-released Win10 Feature Update 1903, Firefox's release 67, and some interesting new data about the prevalence of validly signed malware.</description>

<description>As expected after last week's Tuesday morning end-of-embargo on details of the next round of Intel processor information leakage problems, we will take a closer look at the new challenges they create and the impact of their remediation on system performance and stability. But before that we look at last Tuesday's patches from Microsoft, Adobe, and Apple. We examine a new big security problem for Cisco that even has stock analysts taking notice. We check in on the ongoing troubles with the cryptocurrency market, see what Johns Hopkins associate professor Matthew Green tweeted about the trouble with Google's Titan Bluetooth dongle, and deal with yet another monthly problem with Windows 10 updates. We touch on a bit of miscellany, then wrap up with a look at the new so-called Microarchitectural Data Sampling vulnerabilities.</description>

<description>This week we look at the mess arising from Mozilla's intermediate certificate expiration (the most tweeted event in my feed in a LONG time!), Google's announcement of self-expiring data retention, another wrinkle in the exploit marketplace, Mozilla's announcement about deliberate code obfuscation, a hacker who hacked at least 29 other botnet hackers, a warning about a very popular D-Link netcam, who's paying and who's receiving bug bounties by country, another user-agent gotcha with Google Docs, a problem with Google Earth on the new Chromium Edge browser, and a bit more about Edge's future just dropped at the start of Microsoft's Build 2019 conference.  Then we take a look at the continuing and changing world of cryptojacking after Coinhive closed their doors last month.</description>

<description>This week we look at more privacy fallout from our recent coverage of Facebook and Google.  We examine the uptake rate of recent Windows 10 feature releases.  We finally know the source of the AV troubles with the April Patch Tuesday updates.  We look at the NIST's formal fuzzing development, consider the source of a massive and ongoing database data leak involving more than half of all American households, note that Windows Insiders are already finding that their systems won't update to the May 2019 feature update, and address the concerns of United Airlines passengers who have noticed and been understandably upset by seatback cameras pointing at them.  Finally, we have the "Cranky Old Guy Tip of the Week," touch on a bit of miscellany, then take a look at what many in the security industry are watching with concern:  the large and emerging threat of website credential stuffing attacks.</description>

<description>This week we discuss Google's use of their Sensorvault tracking to assist law enforcement.  It's time to update Drupal again.  And, speaking of "again," Facebook.  We also look at Russia's newly approved legislation moving toward an Internet "off switch," a reminder that "USB Killers" are a real thing, the news of Marcus Hutchins's plea deal, an actively exploited Windows zero-day, a bunch of Microsoft Edge news, the Win7 end-of-life notices, something from the "I did say this was bound to happen" department, and some miscellaneous news.  Then we examine the latest detailed threat research from Cisco's Talos Group about the leveraging of DNSpionage.</description>

<description>This week we discuss a malicious use of the URL tracking "ping" attribute, more on WinRAR, more third-party AV troubles with Microsoft and other new trouble from last week's Patch Tuesday, good things that Patch Tuesday accomplished for Microsoft and for Adobe, another security-tightening change being proposed by Google, Russia's Roskomnadzor finally lowering the boom on Facebook, and the incredible TajMahal APT framework. We touch on a bit of miscellany, answer a SpinRite upgrade question, and share some closing-the-loop feedback from our listeners. We close with a look at Dragonblood, the first effective attack on the new WPA3 protocol (which didn't take long).</description>

Then we're going to take a close look at another capitulation in the (virtually lost) battle against tracking our behavior on the Internet with URL "ping" tracking.</description>

But before that we're going to share some of the continuing news of the WinRAR vulnerability, some really interesting data on Russian GPS hacking, Android's April Fools' Day patches, Tesla autopilot spoofing, some follow-up on the ASUS "ShadowHammer" attack and the targeted MAC addresses, the final release of the Windows 10 (last) October 2018 update, a VMware update, a SQRL question, two bits of listener feedback, and a SpinRite development question. Then we take a look at the state of Android 10 years in.</description>

<description>This week we discuss a number of ongoing out-in-the-wild attacks, along with a bunch of other news.  We have another early-warned Drupal vulnerability that has immediately come under attack in the wild, and a 19-year-old flaw in an obscure decompress for the "ACE" archive format, which until a few days ago WinRAR was supporting to its detriment.  Microsoft reveals an abuse of HTTP/2 protocol which is DoSing its IIS servers.  Mozilla faces a dilemma about a wannabe Certificate Authority, and they also send a worried letter to Australia.  Microsoft's Edge browser is revealed to be secretly whitelisting 58 web domains which are allowed to bypass its "Click-to-Run" permission for FLASH.  ICANN renews its plea for the Internet to adopt DNSSEC, NVIDIA releases a handful of critical driver updates for Windows, and Apple increases the intelligence of its Intelligent Tracking Prevention.</description>

<description>This week we look at Apple's most recent v12.1.4 iOS update and the two zero-day vulnerabilities it closed, as well as examine the very worrisome new Android image display vulnerability.  We dive into an interesting “reverse RDP” attack, look at the new LibreOffice and OpenOffice vulnerability, and consider Microsoft's research into the primary source of software vulnerabilities.  Mary Jo gets an early peek at enterprise pricing for extending Windows 7 support.  China and Russia continue their work to take control of their countries' Internets.  Firefox resumes rollout of its AV-warning Release 65.  We offer up a few more SQRL anecdotes, share a bit of listener feedback, then see how Google does the ChaCha with their new “Adiantum” ultra-high-performance cryptographic cipher.</description>

<description>This week we look at the expressive power of the social media friends we keep, the persistent DNS hijacking campaign which has the U.S. government quite concerned, last week's iOS and macOS updates (and doubtless another one very soon!), a valiant effort to take down malware distribution domains, Chrome catching up to IE and Firefox with drive-by file downloads, two particularly worrisome vulnerabilities in two Cisco router models publicly disclosed last Friday, some interesting miscellany, a particularly poignant SpinRite data recovery testimonial, and then some close looks at the state of the industry and the consequences of extensions to our web browsers.</description>

<description>This week we examine a very worrisome WiFi bug affecting billions of devices; a new fun category for the forthcoming Pwn2Own; Russia's ongoing, failing, and flailing efforts to control the Internet; the return of the Anubis Android banking malware; Google's changing policy for phone and SMS app access; Tim Cook's note in Time magazine; news of a nice Facebook ad auditing page; another Cisco default password nightmare in widely used, lower end devices; some errata, miscellany, and listener feedback.  Then we answer the age-old and apparently quite confusing question:  Which is the right VPN client for Android?</description>

<description>This week we examine the intended and unintended consequences of last week's Windows Patch Tuesday; and, speaking of unintended consequences, the U.S. government shutdown has had some, too.  We also examine a significant privacy failure in WhatsApp, another ransomware decryptor (with a twist), movement on the DNS over TLS front, an expectation of the cyberthreat landscape for 2019, a cloudy forecast for The Weather Channel App, a successful 51% attack against the Ethereum Classic cryptocurrency, another court reversing compelled biometric authentication, and an update on the lingering death of Flash, now in hospice care.  We then look at a bit of miscellany and errata and finish by examining the implications of the recent increase in bounty for the purchase of zero-day vulnerabilities.</description>

<description>This week we look at the NSA's announced forthcoming release of an internal powerful reverse engineering tool for examining and understanding other people's code; emergency out-of-cycle patches from both Adobe and Microsoft; and, yes, we do need to mention PewDiePie again.  We also need to mention our prolific zero-day dropper SandboxEscaper, a new effort by the U.S. government to educate industry about the risks of cyberattacks, some welcome news on the ransomware front, some VERY welcome news of a new Windows 10 feature, and a note about a just-published side-channel attack on OS page caches.  Then we'll wrap with an update on my work on SQRL and my discovery of a VERY impressive and free large file transmission and sharing facility.</description>
